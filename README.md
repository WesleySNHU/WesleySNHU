How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? I can
determine user needs by understanding the user stories that lay out the plan for the developer to create an accurate product.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? The approach
that I take to developing programs is a development that follows the principles of the agile method. These principles are frequent testing,
Collaboration, Communication, and Scrum.

delivers on time, and is responsible.
